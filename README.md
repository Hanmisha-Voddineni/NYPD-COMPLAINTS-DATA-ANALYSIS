__# NYPD-COMPLAINTS-DATA-ANALYSIS__

- The first step of the project involved identifying possible data issues and formulating the problem. The dataset was processed using Pyspark, which enabled the efficient handling of large volumes of data.
- Multiple cleaning strategies were then implemented on the dataset, resulting in clean and reliable data that can be used for further analysis.
- The project involved the creation of 13 highly informative visualizations, each offering a clear view of the most frequent crime rates in each Borough, on specific streets, during certain times in EST, and with reference to sex. These visualizations provide critical insights into crime patterns in New York City and can be used by law enforcement officials and policymakers to make data-driven decisions.
- In addition to data cleaning and visualization, this project also involved the use of advanced statistical techniques to uncover hidden patterns and trends in the NYPD complaint dataset.
- The project also showcased the use of data exploration techniques such as clustering and regression analysis to identify key features that contribute to crime rates in different areas of New York City.
- The project's innovative use of Pyspark, along with its advanced statistical techniques and data exploration strategies, has resulted in a highly efficient, reliable, and informative tool for analyzing and understanding crime patterns in New York City.
